                <h2>Part 1: A Young Man with a Vision</h2>
                <p>
                    Mohammad Mossadegh was born into an influential Iranian family in 1882. From a young age, he showed a strong interest in justice and fairness. Determined to make a difference, he traveled to Europe to study law. In France and Switzerland, Mossadegh learned about legal systems and democratic values that shaped his vision of a just and independent Iran.
                    Returning to Iran, Mossadegh was ready to bring change to his homeland. He believed that true independence would only be possible if Iran controlled its own resources. And in Iran, no resource was more valuable than oil.

                <h2>Part 2: The Fight for Oil</h2>
                <p>
                    In the early 1950s, Iran’s oil industry was dominated by the British. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (now known as BP) controlled the oil fields, taking the majority of the profits, while Iran received only a small share. Mossadegh, now a respected political figure, saw this as unjust. He believed that Iran deserved to benefit from its own resources.
                    In 1951, Mossadegh became the Prime Minister of Iran. One of his first acts as Prime Minister was to nationalize Iran's oil industry. This decision meant that Iran would take full control of its oil and keep the profits for the country’s own development. The people of Iran celebrated this bold move, viewing Mossadegh as a hero who stood up to foreign powers.
