                <h2>Part 3: Resistance and Conflict</h2>
                <p>
                    However, Britain was furious. Losing control of Iranian oil was a major economic loss for them. They demanded that Mossadegh reverse his decision, but he refused. Britain then took its case to the international courts, but Mossadegh defended Iran's right to control its resources with powerful arguments, impressing people worldwide.
                    As tensions grew, Britain, with support from the United States, imposed sanctions on Iran. They believed that by weakening the Iranian economy, they could force Mossadegh to give in. But Mossadegh was determined to stand his ground. He told the world, “Iran is not a country for sale.”

                <h2>Part 4: The Coup and a Lasting Legacy</h2>
                <p>
                    Despite Mossadegh’s resilience, foreign powers saw him as a threat to their interests. In 1953, Britain and the United States orchestrated a coup against him. In a violent and chaotic turn of events, Mossadegh was removed from power, arrested, and put on trial. He was sentenced to house arrest, where he spent the rest of his life.
                    Although he was defeated, Mossadegh’s legacy lived on. He became a symbol of resistance and a hero in the eyes of Iranians. To this day, many Iranians remember Mossadegh as the leader who dared to stand up to powerful nations for the sake of justice and independence.
